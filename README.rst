Python + Webhooks Made Easy

* Free software: BSD license
* Documentation: http://webhooks.rtfd.org.

**WARNING** This project is in a beta state. It's still undergoing some changes and documentation is in-progress.

Python Versions
----------------

Currently works in:

    * Python 2.7
    * Python 3.3

Existing Features
------------------

* Easy to integrate into any package or project
* Comes with several built-in senders for synchronous webhooks.
* Comes with a RedisQ-powered asynchronous webhook.
* Extendable functionality through the use of custom senders and hash functions.

Planned Features
-----------------

* Comes with many built-in senders for synchronous and asynchronous webhooks.
* Special functions for combining multiple sends of identical payloads going to one target into one.
* Follows http://resthooks.org patterns
* Great documentation
* Compatibility with PyPy

Usage
-----

Follow these easy steps:

1. Import the ``webhook`` decorator.
2. Define a function that returns a JSON-serializable dictionary or iterable.
3. Add the ``webhook`` decorator and pass in a ``sender_callable``.
4. Define timeout, any custom headers such as authentication, signing_secret, and encoding (application/json|application/x-www-form-urlencoded)
5. Call the function!

Synchronous example (async examples to come soon):

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from webhooks import webhook
    >>> from webhooks.senders import targeted

    >>> @webhook(sender_callable=targeted.sender)
    >>> def basic(wife, husband, url, encoding, timeout, custom_headers, signing_secret):
    >>>     return {"husband": husband, "wife": wife}

    >>> r = basic("Audrey Roy Greenfeld", "Daniel Roy Greenfeld", url="http://httpbin.org/post", encoding="application/json", \
    >>>     timeout=10, custom_headers = {"Basic" : "dXNlcjpzdXBlcnNlY3JldA=="}, signing_secret="secret1")
    >>> import pprint
    >>> pprint.pprint(r)
